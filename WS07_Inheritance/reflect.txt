1 - 
    No, the base class Hero is independent from any derived class and can have its own
instantiated objects.

2 - 
   Yes, because the SuperHero class inherits the data members and member functions of Hero.

3 - 
   "Ancient Battle" bacause the operator* receives two parameters "Hero" in the Hero class. 
   As Hector is a "Hero" the operator* used is from the Hero class.
   SuperHero class operator* is not used as it needs two "SuperHero" parameters.  

4 - I tested and both worked. You can create the object and use it "on the fly" without the
    need of defining a name for it.
