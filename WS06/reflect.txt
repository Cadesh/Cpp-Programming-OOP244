1 - 
   We check if the address of source object is the same address of the destiny object
because when you uses "new" to resize the phone array in the destiny object
you will mess with the source object as they are the same objects.  

2 - 
   I avoided duplication with the creation of some new functions:
   - Function to count the number of digits in the phone.
   - Funtion to copy values of objects used in copy constructor and = operator.
   - Function to check if the Phone number is valid.

3 - The thing I find more interesting is the possibility 
to resize arrays dinamically to add new data. I also learned about the 
problems related to self-assign objects that can lead to serious errors.
