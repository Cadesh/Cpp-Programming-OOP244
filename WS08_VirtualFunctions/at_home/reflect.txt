1. What is the difference between an abstract base class and a concrete class?

the Abstract classes are never instantiated in objects,
they are just frameworks for the derived classes. 
Concrete classes are classes that can be instantiated in objects. 

2. Identify the functions that shadow functions of the same name in your solution?

   From iAccount all pure virtual functions are rewritten in the derived classes. 
   From Account the functions 'display' and 'monthEnd' are shadowed in ChequingAccount and SavingsAccount.
  

3. Explain what have you learned in this workshop.

    I learned that I can create virtual functions in a base class and then
make them behave differently on each derived class. I can create different 
Data Types but handle them as equals with the use of the base class. 

This is probably the most amazing thing I learned in OOP244:
Manage objects of different types as objects of the same type if I want.
